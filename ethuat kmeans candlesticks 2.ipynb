  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "When traders employ technical analysis, the key information they look at to derive buy or sell signals are the patterns of the candlestick formations. These patterns are defined and recognised by looking at the lengths of each portion of a candlestick relative to the other parts (eg. evening star, morning star, marubozu, dojis, spinning tops, hammers etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The buy and sell signals are further enhanced by looking at candlestick patterns preceding the current one, both independently and as combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, how can we confirm that these pre-defined candlestick patterns are supposed to work as they are intended to? We may be wrong from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, instead of manually identifying the candlestick formations based on prior knowledge obtained from various republished sources, we will let the model explore the data and form its own patterns. (eg. imagine a whole new set of stars, marubozus, dojis, tops, hammers etc)"

    "I will be downloading the full historical price data of the Ethereum daily chart from coinmarketcap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset comes with the **Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Market Cap ** features.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will further engineer 12 new features (but will not use all of them for clustering) from the candlestick data available, these will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **bodyLength** - This is derived as **Open** minus **Close**. The body length of a candle shows the magnitude of the buying/selling pressure <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **upperWick** - This is derived as **High** minus **Open/Close** depending on the 'colour' of the candlestick. The upper wick length of a candlestick represents the extent of profit-taking during the day <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **lowerWick** - This is derived as **Low** minus **Open/Close** depending on the 'colour' of the candlestick. The lower wick length of a candlestick represents the extent of bulls-buying-the-dip <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **CandleLength** - This is derived as **High** minus **Low**. The total candle length indicates the overall price movement during the day. Shorter lengths signifies consolidation and longer lengths signifies volatility. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **body%** - This is derived as **bodyLength/candleLength**. Similar to **body** the ratio of a candlestick's body to its total length shows the magnitude of buying/selling pressure, with an additional data point of being relative to its total candle length. This is useful for showing the body length relative to its time period <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6) **lowerWick%** - This is derived as **lowerWick/candleLength**. Similar to **lowerWick** the ratio of a candlestick's lower wick to its total length shows the magnitude of profit-taking, with an additional data point of being relative to its total candle length. This is useful for showing the lower wick length relative to its time period<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7) **upperWick%** - This is derived as **upperWick/candleLength**. Similar to **lowerWick** the ratio of a candlestick's upper wick to its total length shows the magnitude of bulls-buying-the-dip, with an additional data point of being relative to its total candle length. This is useful for showing the upper wick length relative to its time period<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8) **lower/upper** - This is derived as **lowerWick/upperWick**. The ratio of the length of a candlesticks lower wick to its upper wick shows how much profit-taking there is compared to bulls-buying-the-dip <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9) **lower/body** - This is derived as **lowerWick/bodyLength**. The ratio of the length of a candlesticks lower wick to its body length shows how much bulls-buying-the-dip there is compared to the price range where most of the trading activity occurs. Supposedly, when this ratio is high, the chances of an uptrend increases substantially <br>\n",

    "10) **upper/body** - This is derived as **upperWick/bodyLength**. The ratio of the length of a candlesticks upper wick to its body length shows how much profit-taking there is compared to the price range where most of the trading activity occurs. Supposedly, when this ratio is high, the chances of an downtrend increases substantially \n",
    "\n",
    "11) **volumeChange** - This is derived as **volume[d]/volume[d-1]**. This represents current day's volume as a percentage of the previous day's and is useful to show a standardised volume metric across all time periods\n",
    "\n",
    "12) **McapChange** - This is derived as **Market Cap[d]/Market Cap[d-1]**. This represents current day's Market Cap as a percentage of the previous day's and is useful to show a standardised Market Cap metric across all time periods"
